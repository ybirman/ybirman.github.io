Before moving to California, I attended The University of Alabama â€“ Tuscaloosa. There, I received a B.S. in Chemistry and worked with Dr. Patrick Frantom to conduct mechanistic studies on enzyme function and regulation. My current research interests are in the areas of membrane biophysics and structural biology. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
